                  Before long the searchlight discovered some distance away a
                  schooner with all sails set, apparently the same vessel which
                  had been noticed earlier in the evening. The wind had by this
                  time backed to the east, and there was a shudder amongst the
                  watchers on the cliff as they realized the terrible danger in
                  which she now was. Between her and the port lay the great flat
                  reef on which so many good ships have from time to time
                  suffered, and, with the wind blowing from its present quarter,
                  it would be quite impossible that she should fetch the
                  entrance of the harbour.
                </p>

                  <p className="mb-5">
                    It was now nearly the hour of high tide, but the waves were
                    so great that in their troughs the shallows of the shore
                    were almost visible, and the schooner, with all sails set,
                    was rushing with such speed that, in the words of one old
                    salt, &#8220;she must fetch up somewhere, if it was only in
                    hell.

                  <p className="mb-5">
                    Then came another rush of sea-fog, greater than any
                    hitherto--a mass of dank mist, which seemed to close on all
                    things like a grey pall, and left available to men only the
                    organ of hearing, for the roar of the tempest, and the crash
                    of the thunder, and the booming of the mighty billows came
                    through the damp oblivion even louder than before.

                    The rays of the searchlight were kept fixed on the harbour
                    mouth across the East Pier, where the shock was expected,
                    and men waited breathless. The wind suddenly shifted to the
                    north-east, and the remnant of the sea-fog melted in the
                    blast; and then, mirabile dictu, between the piers, leaping
                    from wave to wave as it rushed at headlong speed, swept the
                    strange schooner before the blast, with all sail set, and
                    gained the safety of the harbour.

                      The searchlight followed her, and a shudder ran through
                      all who saw her, for lashed to the helm was a corpse, with
                      drooping head, which swung horribly to and fro at each
                      motion of the ship.

                    <li className="mb-3">
                      No other form could be seen on deck at all. A great awe
                      came on all as they realised that the ship, as if by a
                      miracle, had found the harbour, unsteered save by the hand
                      of a dead man! However, all took place more quickly than
                      it takes to write these words.

                    <li className="mb-3">
                      The schooner paused not, but rushing across the harbour,
                      pitched herself on that accumulation of sand and gravel
                      washed by many tides and many storms into the south-east
                      corner of the pier jutting under the East Cliff, known
                      locally as Tate Hill Pier.

                  <p className="mb-3">
                    There was of course a considerable concussion as the vessel
                    drove up on the sand heap. Every spar, rope, and stay was
                    strained, and some of the &#8220;top-hammer&#8221; came
                    crashing down. But, strangest of all, the very instant the
                    shore was touched, an immense dog sprang up on deck from
                    below, as if shot up by the concussion, and running forward,
                    jumped from the bow on the sand.

                    Making straight for the steep cliff, where the churchyard
                    hangs over the laneway to the East Pier so steeply that some
                    of the flat tombstones--&#8220;thruff-steans&#8221; or
                    &#8220;through-stones,&#8221; as they call them in the
                    Whitby vernacular--actually project over where the
                    sustaining cliff has fallen away, it disappeared in the
                    darkness, which seemed intensified just beyond the focus of
                    the searchlight.

                  <p className="mb-3">
                    It so happened that there was no one at the moment on Tate
                    Hill Pier, as all those whose houses are in close proximity
                    were either in bed or were out on the heights above. Thus
                    the coastguard on duty on the eastern side of the harbour,
                    who at once ran down to the little pier, was the first to
                    climb on board. The men working the searchlight, after
                    scouring the entrance of the harbour without seeing
                    anything, then turned the light on the derelict and kept it
                    there.
